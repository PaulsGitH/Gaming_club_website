    <h2>Welcome to the SETU students Retro gaming club</h2>
<p><img src="images/nintendo-system.jpg" width="400" height="400"
        alt="The original nintendo and some of it's classic library" class = "feature img-fluid"></p>
    <p>Drop by, and play some old school classics as they were meant to be 
        played! on original hardware and a CRT TV, games will be more
        difficult than most modern gamers are used to, earning the nickname "Nintendo hard!".
        Not for the feint of heart were the games of this era. Limited lives and continues and
        punishing checkpoints. Your fun will last as long as your patience. </p>

    <h2>Initial Plan for club</h2>  

    <p>This club was intended to also bring back the joys of couch based multiplayer,
      The move to everything being online just isn't the same, I personally see no difference
      between playing games with bots or people online. There's nothing quite like when many people
      are playing a game together, no headsets, no online, just fun.
    </p>

    <h2>How the club started</h2>

    <p>A bunch of computing students had a lot of old consoles and games between us, so we
      decided that, intead of trying to sell them, we would instead use them as part of a
      club that people could join, that liked playing retro games.
